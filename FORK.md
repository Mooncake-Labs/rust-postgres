## Overview

This repository is a **fork of [`imor/rust-postgres`](https://github.com/imor/rust-postgres)**, at commit `548f00c4cbcf7bd714c29cfd2fea7685040c9987` which is a fork of [`MaterializeInc/rust-postgres`](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/rust-postgres), which itself is a fork of the original [`sfackler/rust-postgres`](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres) crate.

We have forked and customized it for use within the **Mooncake project**, specifically to support advanced features of the PostgreSQL **logical replication protocol**, including plans to support **Logical Replication Protocol v2** introduced in PostgreSQL 15.
